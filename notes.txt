classic theme needs custom icons and modern theme needs default icons
Forecast feature has weather icons

The 15 minute thing cannot be done for free tier (we can do 1 hour) - no time

Printing functionality - no time





----------------------------------------------------------------
For the auto-refresh feature, you can use JavaScript's setInterval function to call your 
function that fetches the weather data every 15 minutes. Here's a simplified example:
// Function to fetch weather
function fetchAndUpdateWeather() {
    // Your fetch call to the API
    // Update the UI with new data
}

// Set interval to call the fetchAndUpdateWeather every 15 minutes
setInterval(fetchAndUpdateWeather, 900000); // 900000 milliseconds = 15 minutes

Remember to clear this interval if the user navigates away from the page or when it's 
no longer needed to avoid unnecessary API calls and potential memory leaks. rip




As for the custom weather icons, you would likely have an object or function 
that maps weather conditions to your icon filenames. For instance:
const weatherIcons = {
    "Sunny": "sunny.png",
    "Partly Cloudy": "partly-cloudy.png",
    // ... other mappings ...
};

function getWeatherIcon(condition) {
    // Return the filename for the custom icon based on the condition
    return weatherIcons[condition] || "default.png"; // Fallback to a default icon
}

// When updating the UI with weather data:
const condition = data.current.condition.text; // Assume this is the condition from the API
const iconFileName = getWeatherIcon(condition);
// Set the image source to the icon
document.getElementById("weather-icon").src = `/path/to/icons/${iconFileName}`;
