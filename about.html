    <div class="projectDescription">Weather Machine is a group project that we developed for our software engineering class.
        By entering a location into the search bar you will be able to see many different attributes of the weather conditions in the specified location.
        You can choose to search additional locations in order to compare some of the attributes them or use the filter to display only the wanted information.
        The glossary page helps to define any terms that may require some defining. The Api used here is from "http://api.weatherapi.com". It is a free weather
        Information API that provides accurate, location-specific information on weather.

        We wanted to make this program because weather is important. It is also nice to be able to compare many locations
        at once. This app does both. For us, this was our first delving into the world of API usage, and it was a very solid
        learning experience that taught us a lot about proper interaction and information transfer.
